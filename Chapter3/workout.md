The most important issue in this chapter is the ambiguity between the usage of Jacobian and Adjoint matrices for transforming spatial velocities. The distinction lies in the continuous differentiability between the frames. For frames that lie on the same rigid body, adjoint matrix is the tool for transforming spatial velocities, because continuous differentiability holds between them. For frames that are not on the same rigid body, Jacobian matrix has to be used because this requirement does not hold. As an example, consider manipulator links where the link endpoints have discontinuities.
