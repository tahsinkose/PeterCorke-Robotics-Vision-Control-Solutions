    "# Relationship Between Plücker, Screw and Twist Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plücker Coordinates\n",
    "3D Lines are special geometric objects that have only 4 DoF. As their length is infinite, they require a different representation. It is possible to represent lines with 2 vectors:\n",
    "* 2 points on the line\n",
    "* A vector to a point on the line (point vector from the origin) and the direction vector of the line\n",
    "* A moment vector and the direction vector of the line (Plücker coordinates)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plücker coordinates are favorable with respect to other two, because they can be specified without any particular point on the line. The moment vector $m$ is shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![3D Line](visuals/line_3d.png \"3D Line\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an orthogonal vector of line $l$. Better yet, it does not change if another point -say $p'$- is taken on the line. Let's prove that quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{p'} \\times \\hat{l} = ((\\vec{p} + (\\vec{p'} - \\vec{p})) \\times \\hat{l}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{p'} \\times \\hat{l} = \\vec{p} \\times \\hat{l} + \\lambda \\hat{l} \\times \\hat{l}$, where $\\vec{p'} - \\vec{p} = \\lambda \\hat{l}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{p'} \\times \\hat{l} = \\vec{m} \\blacksquare$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can uniquely express a line in 3D as $l = (\\hat{l}$, $\\vec{m})$, which is known as Plücker coordinates. It is important to note that $\\hat{l} \\cdot\\vec{m} = 0$ as a constraint for this representation, which will be useful in next chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Screw Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "A line itself does not represent a motion. For that we need to introduce a term called *pitch* next to the line. These together define the **screw motion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = (\\hat{s}, \\vec{sm}) = (\\hat{l}, \\vec{m} + k\\cdot\\hat{l})$, where $l = (\\hat{l}$, $\\vec{m})$ and $k$ is the scalar that represents pitch. The following simplified figure shows a comparison of different $k$ parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pitch Comparison](visuals/pitch_comparison.png \"Pitch Comparison\")\n",
    "\n",
    "When $k = \\infty$, $\\vec{sm}$ becomes parallel with $\\hat{l}$, which means pure translation. An astute reader may ask \"How does this lead the first argument to vanish?\". That is a very good observation, which will be explained at the end of this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Twist Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "A screw could be considered a unit motion -a unit means 1 radian in this context- in SE(3) space that specifies a particular spatial displacement. This geometric object can be used as a function that takes the magnitude as its parameter. In mathematical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S \\rightarrow \\Delta \\hat{p}$, where $S$ represents the screw motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "$S (\\theta) \\rightarrow \\theta\\Delta \\hat{p}$, where $\\theta$ is the parameter that determines the magnitude of spatial displacement $\\Delta \\hat{p}$ and $S(\\theta)$ is the twist. When we plug the magnitude parameter in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S (\\theta) = (\\theta \\hat{l}, \\theta\\vec{m} + \\theta k\\cdot\\hat{l})$. We can do a final substitution of pitch as $k =\\dfrac{d}{\\theta}$, where $d$ represents the distance of translation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$S (\\theta) = (\\theta \\hat{l}, \\theta\\vec{m} + d\\cdot\\hat{l})$. At this point we will revisit the ideas of pure translation and rotation. In below, we first mathematically show that an infinite pitch results in a unit pure-translational motion. It must be noted that an infinite pitch does not lead to a translational motion that has an infinite magnitude. The pitch argument only determines the directionality of the motion in SE(3) space. Therefore the distance of the translation is invariant under different pitch values. On the contrary, an infinite $k$ value implies a particular value of $\\theta$, when $d$ is finite:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{\\theta\\to0} k = \\infty$, where $k =\\dfrac{d}{\\theta}$, which leads to the following screw motion $(\\hat{l},  \\vec{m} + k\\cdot\\hat{l}) \\equiv (0,  \\vec{m} + \\infty\\cdot\\hat{l})$ that is pure translation, which is also shown in the figure above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pure rotation, we need $k = 0$, which is achieved when $d = 0$ and $\\theta \\neq 0$. Note that $\\theta \\neq 0$ holds *argumentum a contrario*. Let's say $\\theta = 0$ and $d=0$ results in a valid Plücker coordinates. In this case $S(\\theta)$ becomes $(0\\hat{l}, 0\\vec{m} + 0\\cdot\\hat{l})$, which is $(0,0)$. However this coordinate is not included in Plücker coordinates. This concludes that $\\theta \\neq 0 \\; \\forall \\theta \\; | \\; d = 0$ in the space of Plücker coordinates $\\blacksquare$ \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure rotation is essentially a pitchless motion, that's why it is identical to scaled Plücker coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S(\\theta) = (\\theta \\hat{l}, \\theta\\vec{m})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a plot of how increasing pitch affects the screw moment vector. It is clearly visible that as it goes to $\\infty$, the motion becomes pure translation -- i.e. aligned with $\\hat{l}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Increase in pitch](visuals/increase_in_pitch.gif \"Increase in Pitch\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually important to retrieve $k, \\theta, d$ parameters in applications involving twists. Let's quickly have a look in how they can be recovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recovering pitch from screw coordinates is straightforward. Recall its definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = (\\hat{s}, \\vec{sm}) = (\\hat{l}, \\vec{m} + k\\cdot\\hat{l})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{s} \\cdot \\vec{sm} = \\hat{l} \\cdot \\vec{m} + k\\hat{l} \\cdot \\hat{l} = k |\\hat{l}|^2 = k$\n",
    "\n",
    "$k = \\hat{s} \\cdot \\vec{sm}$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Recovering pitch from twist coordinates is slightly more complicated. Recall its definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S (\\theta) = (\\vec{t}, \\vec{tm}) = (\\theta \\hat{l}, \\theta\\vec{m} + \\theta k\\cdot\\hat{l})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{t} \\cdot \\vec{tm} = \\theta^2 (\\hat{l} \\cdot \\vec{m}) + \\theta^2k|\\hat{l}|^2 =  \\theta^2k|\\hat{l}|^2 = \\theta^2k$\n",
    "\n",
    "$k = \\dfrac{\\vec{t} \\cdot \\vec{tm}}{\\theta^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, recovering $\\theta$ and $d$ from twist coordinates is straightforward as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta = |\\vec{tm}|, \\; d = \\theta \\cdot k $"
